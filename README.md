# CozmoAI

This project was something I started as a senior project in high school and intend to continue working on throughout college in my spare time. It is intended to be a learning AI by the end of the project, one which can complete a maze and remember the path to the end. The more trials the quicker the solution is ideally found, regardless of the size of the maze or the number of wrong turns takne initially.

When I began the project I had almost no knowledge of python and so I began running simulations of the program through Java and a provided University Interscholastic League lab very similar to my goal. Some of the progress in python was in an unnecessary direction and will be removed once the project is complete, however until then I'd like to keep it as reference material in the event that I discover an issue which would require that specific solution.

The program is intended to run on the Cozmo bot developed by Anki, and all credit goes where it's due for the original software and hardware developed which make this entire project possible.
